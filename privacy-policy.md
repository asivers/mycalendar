# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** 19 June 2025

## 1. Source Code
**Calendar without ads** is open-source:  
[https://github.com/asivers/mycalendar](https://github.com/asivers/mycalendar)

## 2. Data Handling
**We do not collect, transmit, or store any data outside of the user's device**. The app processes locally:
- **User-created notes**
- **App settings values** such as selected theme, language, country etc.
- **System locale** (e.g., `en-US`) used for initial language and country detection

All data remains **exclusively on the user's device** and is never accessible to us or any third parties.
The app does not require internet access and operates entirely offline.

### Compliance Notes:
- **GDPR**: Data is processed under contractual necessity (app functionality). User can delete notes/settings anytime.
- **152-FZ (Russia)**: No personal data is processed as defined by law, as all data remains on-device.

## 3. Permissions
- **User-granted**:
    - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` – For displaying reminders.
    - `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` – For scheduling alarms.
- **Automatic (system-granted)**:
    - `VIBRATE` – Haptic feedback for alarms.
    - `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` – Restores alarms after reboot.

**No other permissions are required**.

## 4. Changes to Policy
If we update this Privacy Policy, updated policies will be bundled with app updates and shown on first launch.  
The latest version is always available in [Settings > Privacy Policy].
