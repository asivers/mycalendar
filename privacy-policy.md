# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** 15 June 2025

## 1. Data Collection
**Calendar without ads** **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive user data**. The app processes:
- **User-created notes** (stored locally on your device).
- **System locale** (e.g., `en-US`) to adjust app behavior (language and holidays for country).
All data **remains strictly on your device**. The app does not require internet access and operates entirely offline.
We do not track users, do not use analytics, and do not share data with third parties.

## 2. Permissions
- **User-granted**:
    - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` – For displaying reminders.
    - `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` – For scheduling alarms.
- **Automatic (system-granted)**:
    - `VIBRATE` – Haptic feedback for alarms.
    - `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` – Restores alarms after reboot.
**No other permissions are required**.

## 3. Changes to This Policy
If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify users within the app.
