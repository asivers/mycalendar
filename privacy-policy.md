# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** 20 June 2025

## 1. Source Code
**Calendar without ads** is open-source:  
[https://github.com/asivers/mycalendar](https://github.com/asivers/mycalendar)

## 2. Data Handling
**We do not collect, transmit, or store any data outside of the user's device**. The app processes locally:
- **User-created notes**
- **App settings values** such as selected theme, language, country etc.
- **System locale** (e.g., `en-US`) used for initial language and country detection

All data remains **exclusively on the user's device** and is never accessible to us or any third parties.
The app does not require internet access and operates entirely offline.
The user can delete notes and other app data at any time.

### Compliance Notes:
- **152-FZ (Russia)**: No personal data is processed as defined by law, as all data remains on-device.

## 3. Permissions
- **User-granted**:
    - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` – For displaying reminders.
    - `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` – For scheduling alarms.
- **Automatic (system-granted)**:
    - `VIBRATE` – Haptic feedback for alarms.
    - `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` – Restores alarms after reboot.

**No other permissions are required**.

## 4. Changes to Policy
The app works entirely offline, so if there are changes to the Privacy Policy, they will be delivered through app updates via Google Play and other app stores.
On first launch after an update, a notification about changes to the Privacy Policy will be displayed.

The latest version is always available in [Settings > Privacy Policy].
